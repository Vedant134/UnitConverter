 * UnitConverter.java
 * 
 * Takes the unit inches and converts into many other units that are 
 equivalent to inches
 
 
 * Psecudocode= plan
 * D&I and field variable inches as we can use it in several methods
 * D&I the feet, inches, cm variables in main method 
 * Asks the user for the measurement in inches (Reads in)
 * Create the method InchestoFeet() which converts inches to feet and 
 returns the value to the method which was greated at top (no parameters!)
 * Creates the method InchestoCm () which converts inches to cm and 
 returns the value to the exisiting method (also no parameters because 
 of field variable)
 * Creates the method FeetToInches() and then converts it to inches, and returns the value
as feet to the method, and takes in parameter feet
* Print method- for printing out all the conversions from the original unit
inches, taking in parameters with different names (reperesnting same idea)
